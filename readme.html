<P>SmartCTF is a mutator to promote teamplay in CTF games. It has a special scoring system, as well as an advanced 
scoreboard showing various teamplay orientated statistics. And many, many more features.</P>

<P>This page contains documentation about the tweaking and modifications done in SmartCTF mod</P>
<P>This mod was originally made by <B>{PiN}Kev</B> around January 2004, and linked to 
<A HREF="http://pin.progameplayer.com/SmartCTF">http://pin.progameplayer.com/SmartCTF</A> 
but that site doesn't seem to work anymore.</P>
Tweaked by <B><A HREF="http://www.clanbase.com/personinfo.php?pid=1591401">{DnF2}SiNiSTeR</A></B> in January - March 2005. Besides listing his changes, on this site you can 
also find an user / admin manual.</P>
<P>Version 4D was made by [es]Rush, Version 4D++ was made by Adminthis,changes are listed in the Changelog.</P>

<P>The_Cowboy and Sp0ngeb0b proudly present SmartCTF 4E!</P>

</TD>
<TD><OL>
<LI>Totally renewed and vamped the SmartCTF scoreboard!
  <UL TYPE="square">
	<LI>The SmartCTF scoreboard now replaces the original scoreboard instead of painting over your HUD. But no worries, 
	you can toggle between the normal scoreboard and SmartCTF scoreboard with the familiar command "mutate SmartCTF Stats". 
	Also by default you won't see the SmartCTF scoreboard until the game has ended like with every other SmartCTF version. 
	Therefore there should be no disadvantages, just the advantage that your HUD does not get screwed up anymore on occasion! 
	(Like	your Chat Area being hidden again...)</LI>
  <LI>Furthermore the scoreboard looks much sexier. Read on...</LI>
	<LI>For starters, players are accompanied by the face of their player model (avatar).</LI>
  <LI>There is a dark shading behind the data for better readibility of compressed screenshots.</LI>
  <LI>The statistic bars are now a ratio of the maximum, not the total.</LI>
  <LI>Players have extra stats: Efficiency, number of HeadShots, ShieldBelt and Damage Amp pickups.</LI>
  <LI>Therefore ping and packetloss is displayed under the avatar.</LI>
  <LI>The team headers if some extra information as well. These are average ping and packetloss for that team, 
	and percent of total SB/Amp pickups.</LI>		
  <LI>In the bottom of the screen the tickrate of the server will now display (at the end of the server line).</LI>
  <LI>All this data is also dynamic, trying to get as much players to fit on the screen as possible. It 
	supports upto 18 players at a resolution 1024x768.</LI>		
  </UL>
<LI>Several bugfixes:
  <UL TYPE="square">
  <LI>Now compatible with UTPure's WarmUp Mode!</LI>
  <LI>Fixed "multiple player name" bug at end of game when people leave and join.</LI>
  <LI>No more "Long Range" messages when killing with a <I>zoomed</I> sniper.</LI>
  <LI>Show FC Location (bShowFCLocation in .ini) can actually be disabled now.</LI>
  <LI>As well as bPlay30SecSound, but this is tricky. When enabled, it changes a setting on the client when the player joins. This 
  change remains until that player quits UT. So he could also hear the sound when joining a non-SmartCTF server later ;)</LI>
  <LI>Fixed a scoring error for flagreturns (mid/base swapped).</LI>
  </UL>
<LI>More specific SmartCTF logging, also fills the Flag Assist column for <A HREF="http://www.unrealadmin.org/forums/showthread.php?t=9556">UTStats beta 3 by azazel</A>!
<LI>Optional Spawnkill Detection, with score penalties and messages.</LI>
<LI>SmartCTF Server Info (F2), including Record Holders for various stats.</LI>
<LI>Optional "You Got The Lead"/"You Lost The Lead" announcer sounds at capping.
<LI>Included "Overtime Control".</LI>
<LI>New cap/assist scoring system.</LI>
<LI>Console command "mutate SmartCTF ForceEnd" to force a game to end.</LI>
<LI>Console command "mutate CTFInfo", like UTPure's "CheatInfo".</LI>
<LI>"MonsterAnnouncer" for Enhanced MultiKill (broadcast multi kills etc. in console for example for reporterbot).</LI>
<LI>Keybind for stat toggling can be selected in UT Settings / Controls.</LI> 
<LI>Made the startup logo smaller.</LI>
<LI>Decreased filesize with ~one third.</LI>
<LI>Decreased network usage by ~half.</LI>
<LI>Works better on standalone games. But keep in mind it was programmed for a dedicated server.</LI>
<LI><I>A lot</I> general code improvements, optimalizations and changes.</LI>

<LI>Fixes the "flagbug" where the flag is sent home when the FC disconnects. Now it is dropped there.</LI>
<LI>Lots of booleans you can set in the .ini file to hide certain SmartCTF messages on your server.</LI>
<LI>Same goes for setting SmartCTF bonuses and almost every other SmartCTF feature.</LI>
<LI>Can be setup as Server Actor so you don't have to select the mutator each time. Doesn't load for non-CTF gametypes.</LI>
<LI>Optional 'Assist' sound at assist, 'Capture' sound at capture and 'Nice Catch' sound at save.</LI>

<P>SmartCTF is a client- and serverside mod. This means it has to be installed on the server. It should also 
be added to the ServerPackages so clients will download it automatically to be able to see stats and 
the likes.</P>
<P>The steps for Server Administrators are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Remove all earlier versions of SmartCTF to avoid conflicts!</P></LI>
<LI><P>Extract the <B>.ini</B>, <B>.int</B>, and <B>.u</B> files in the <B>UT\System</B> directory.</P></LI>
<LI><P>You can extract the readme file to <B>UT\Help</B> if you want.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Now open <B>UnrealTournament.ini</B> (in your <B>UT\System</B> folder) and look for <B>[Engine.GameEngine]</B>.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Add the following to the list of 'ServerPackages=':<BR>
<B>ServerPackages=SmartCTF_4E</B></P></LI>
<LI><P>If you want to use <b>IpToCountry</b> you also have to have these: "ServerPackages=CountryFlags2" and "ServerActors=IpToCountry.LinkActor", but that should be described in IpToCountry's readme, and besides you need the IpToCountry.u.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Also, if you don't want to select the SmartCTF mutator each time but have it be added to CTF games by default, 
you have to add another line to <I><U>the end of the list</U></I> of 'ServerActors=':<BR>
<B>ServerActors=SmartCTF_4E.SmartCTFServerActor</B></P></LI>
<LI><P>There's a reason this has to be added at the end. The mutator will take the current scoreboard to show by default, but meanwhile 
replace it with the SmartCTF scoreboard. If say the ScoreBoard utility MODOSUtilV25 gets loaded <I>after</I> SmartCTF, the MODOS 
scoreboard won't get detected, or the SmartCTF scoreboard won't show. Note that UTPure also changes the scoreboard in Tournament games, for the clickboard. 
So place it after UTPure too.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Also, SmartCTF Server Info won't work if you insert the package in the list before UTPure!</P></LI>
<LI><P>For the same reasons, if you don't use the ServerActor but add the mutator manually, try sticking it 
at the end of the mutator list.</P></LI>
<LI><P>An usual mistake is to edit the UT .ini file while the server is still running. You won't be able to make changes to 
the file that way.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Ready to go!</P></LI>

<TD>Here you can enter the SmartCTF bonuses. Remember this gets added to default UT scorings. 
You can only enter integer numbers, and can use something like -1 to decrease in score, for example  
setting FlagKillBonus to -1 will give 4 points instead of standard 5 on a flagkill. See <A HREF="#rules">Scoring</A>.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>bFixFlagBug</TD><TD>True</TD>
<TD>If True, the flag will be dropped if the FC disconnects or lags out, instead of being sent home which is the 
default UT functionality. Hopefully this will prevent some 'lagoutcaps' in clanwars.</TD></TR>

<TD>Enable enhanced multikills. Inserts 2 extra phases, in color changing messages and unlimited MonsterKills.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>EnhancedMultiKillBroadcast</TD><TD>3</TD>
<TD>Ignored if bEnhancedMultiKill = False. Since the MonsterAnnouncer mod is incompatible with Enhanced Multkill, SmartCTF 
has a built-in function for it. It will display a message in the console if a player gets a Multi Kill, Triple Kill etc.<BR>
The value decides from which multkill-level onwards a message should be displayed (as in 2 = Double Kill, 3 = Triple Kill, etc). 
0 = no message will be displayed.<BR><BR>
If you want this functionality but don't want Enhanced MultiKill, use <A HREF="http://www.unrealadmin.org/forums/showthread.php?t=6461"

* The 1 score you get from UT is because of the normal kill you did.<BR>

<H3>Rules</H3>
<UL>
<LI><P>An <B>Assist</B> is if you carried the flag, but dropped it and a teammember took over and capped.</P></LI>
<LI><P>A <B>Cover</B> is defined as a kill while defending your flagcarrier. This has to do with distance as well as enemies 
seeing the flagcarrier.</P></LI>
<LI><P>A <B>Seal</B> is defined by:<BR>
1) Your FC is on your team's side of map.<BR> 
2) Your flag is not taken.<BR>
3) You kill some one on your side of the map.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If the FC that you covered and/or sealed off the base for, caps, then you once again get bonuses for each 
such kill you made (so coverkills x 2 pts, sealkills x 2 pts).</P></LI>
<LI><P>Seals and Flagreturns require maps with proper zone names, that is player locations 
that contain "Red", "Blue" and "Mid" in their text.</P></LI>
<LI><P>A <B>Flagsave</B> is a Flagreturn really close to the enemy flag which has not been taken. 
This is accompanied by a "Saved By" message.</P></LI>
<LI><P>A <B>Spawnkill</B> is defined in the <A HREF="#faq">FAQ</A>.</P></LI>

</UL>

<H3>New cap/assist scoring</H3>

<P>With the setting <B>bNewCapAssistScoring</B> enabled, the points for Assist and Captures will be divided based on 
the time each player carried the flag!</P>
<P>It uses the total amount of points normally awarded for a capture (by default 15, see table). So you can configure 
<B>CapBonus</B> to change this. If you capped a flag doing a solorun, then you get all the points because you 
carried it 100% of the time. If someone carries a flag for 15 seconds, drops it, you pick it up, carry it for 5 seconds 
then cap, then you get 25% of the points and the assister 75% of 15 points.<BR>
If you drop a flag and later pick it up again, then the new time will be added to the old.</P>
<P>There's also a setting to give a flagcapper a minimal bonus. For example if someone pickups a dropped flag 1 meter 
for the flag and caps, he would get very little points, even if it was a nice rescue. With <B>MinimalCapBonus</B> you can 
adjust this and set a lower bound. By default this is 5, so a capture would give you <I>at least</I> 5 points. 
More if applicable.</P>
<P>With <B>bShowAssistConsoleMsg</B> on True, you will see a console message telling you how much seconds you carried it.</P>
<P>This was not fully my idea, because I've played on a server once with this functionality enabled. I don't know how the mod 
was called, how it exactly worked or who made it, and couldn't find anything on the Internet. So I just went and made my 
own implementation of it. But credit to whoever's original idea it was.</P>

<P>The following commands can be typed by clients in the console:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P><B>mutate smartctf</B><BR>General info.</P></LI>
<LI><P><B>mutate smartctf stats</B><BR>Toggle between the default scoreboard and the SmartCTF scoreboard. Basically this 
sets what you will see under F1. In the top right corner of the screen you can see for a moment which is selected. 
When the game starts, you always begin with the default. When it ends, you will always toggle to the SmartCTF scoreboard.</P></LI>
<LI><P><B>mutate ctfinfo</B><BR>Gives an overview of all SmartCTF related settings on that server 
(Like UTPure's "CheatInfo" command).</P></LI>
<LI><P><B>mutate smartctf rules</B><BR>Shows all bonuses settings for the server.</P></LI>
<LI><P><B>mutate smartctf forceend</B><BR>An admin can force the game to end, even if it is a tie. 
SmartCTF ScoreBoard will also show up.</P></LI>
<LI><P><B>mutate smartctf clearstats</B><BR>Admins can also choose to clear the SmartCTF stats.</P></LI>
<LI><P><B>mutate overtime &lt;on|off&gt;</B><BR>Only matters when bEnableOvertimeControl is True. By simply typing "mutate 
overtime" you can check if Sudden Death Overtime is currently enabled (by default it is). "mutate overtime off" (admins 
only) will make sure that if the map ends in a tie when the timelimit is reached, the game ends anyway. 
Don't use for decider maps! See the FAQ for detailed information.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P>A good tip is to bind the toggle command to F3. This key only gets used for Assault so 
for CTF its free. Bind F3 as follows in your <B>User.ini</B>:<BR>
<B>F3=ShowObjectives | mutate smartctf showstats</B></P>
<P>Now it will display the objectives during an Assault game and toggle the SmartCTF statboard during 
a CTF game (also compatible with older versions of SmartCTF).</P>
<P>Note: you can now also bind the command using the UT settings window, under Controls.<BR>-=EDIT=-<BR><B>No need for this now :P</B></P>

<LI><P><B>When is a kill defined as a cover kill?</B><BR>
Here is the technical information. When:<BR>
- the victim is within 512 uu (10 meter) of your flagcarrier, or<BR>
- you are within 512 uu (10 meter) of your flagcarrier, or<BR>
- the victim is within 1536 (30 meter) of your flagcarrier and can see him, or<BR>
- the victim is within 1024 (20 meter) of your flagcarrier and you can see your flagcarrier, or<BR>
- the victim is within 768 (15 meter) of your flagcarrier and can see him if he turned.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>When is a kill defined as a seal?</B><BR>
a) The opponent's team doesn't have the flag, but your team has.<BR>
b) You kill an enemy on your side of the map.<BR>
c) Your flagcarrier is also on your side of the map.<BR>
"Your side of the map" means you are in a level zone with your color in its name 
(Like "Red Base" or "Blue Corridor").</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>How does SmartCTF check where I return a flag?</B><BR>
It checks the names of the level zone you are in when you did the kill 
(like "Red Base", "Blue Corridor" or "Upper Mid").<BR>
Let's say your team is Red, then it checks for, and rewards as:<BR>
"red" = Return in your base.<BR>
"blue" = Return in enemy base.<BR>
Neither = Return in the middle.<BR>
900 uu (17 meter) from opponent flag = Close save.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>What is Overtime Control?</B><BR>
This setting allows you to control whether Sudden Death Overtime should kick in, 
when the time limit is reached and the cap scores are currently tied. If you don't 
want to worry about this, simply leave <I>bEnableOvertimeControl</I> to False.<BR><BR>
If it's set to True, you can set <I>bOvertime</I> to control it. You may want to use this 
for official maps to make sure your opponent won't have a deciding cap 0.5 seconds 
out of time (this is hard to tell). Instead, make sure the game ends even when 
its tied. <I>bOvertime</I> = False does just that. For deciders don't forget to set 
<I>bOvertime</I> back to True.<BR><BR>
Because this is a tricky setting considering deciders (which require overtime), 
you won't want to mess this up. By default <I>bRememberOvertimeSetting</I> = False, making 
sure at each mapchange, <I>bOvertime</I> will be set back to True (= safe). Setting it 
to True will ensure the <I>bOvertime</I> setting gets remembered through mapchanges.<BR><BR>
Use "mutate overtime" to see the current setting. Also, when the tournament 
game starts, you will see a big text for a few seconds, indicating whether it 
is on or off. <A HREF="#commands">See Commands section.</A>
</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>How do I see stats mid-game?</B><BR>
You know the answer</LI>

<LI><P><B>OMG I'm a spawnkiller! How does SmartCTF define this?</B><BR>
You get a spawnkill whenever you kill someone who has spawned less than 5 seconds ago, 
AND hasen't picked up any weapons or meaningfull pickups yet. Thus, is defenseless.<BR><BR>
The rule for Arena games such as Instagib, Rocket Launcher Arena and Sniper Arena is 
different. Then, a spawnkill is any kill within 1 second after your victim spawned.<BR><BR>
If you get 3 spawnkills in a row without dieing yourself, the server can be configured to 
broadcast a message saying you are a LAMER!<BR>
<BR>
From version 4C, the mentioned timelimits can be configured with 
<I>SpawnKillTimeNW</I> and <I>SpawnKillTimeArena</I>.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>What do the abbreviations on the statboard mean?</B><BR>
<I>Personal stats;</I> <U>HS</U>: Number of HeadShots made, <U>SB</U>: number of ShieldBelt pickups, 
<U>AM</U>: number of Damage Amplifier pickups, <U>TM</U>: time in minutes in the game, <U>EFF</U>: efficieny 
aka the frag/death ratio, <U>P</U>/<U>PI</U>: ping, <U>L</U>/<U>PL</U>: packetloss %.<BR>
